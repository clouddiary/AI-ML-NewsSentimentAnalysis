# AI-ML-NewsSentimentAnalysis

In this project I used textblob, NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) & Newspaper3k python libraries to extract news articals from various sources & perform sentiment analysis. Final results are dumped in a csv files for review.

Sources 
1) RSS Feed of any news website
2) Multiple artiles in the form of csv
3) Single article.
